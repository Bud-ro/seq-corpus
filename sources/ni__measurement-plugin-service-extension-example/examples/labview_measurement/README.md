# NI-DCPower Source DC Voltage

This is a measurement plug-in example that sources and measures a DC voltage with an NI SMU and
includes additional functionality to log measurement data using a custom logging service.

## Features

- Showcases the usage of a user-defined logger service that logs the measurement data.
- Uses the NI-DCPower LabVIEW API
- Pin-aware, supporting one session and multiple pins
  - Sources the same DC voltage level on all selected pin/site combinations
  - Measures the DC voltage and current for each selected pin/site combination
- Includes a TestStand sequence showing how to configure the pin map, register instrument sessions
  with the session management service, and run a measurement.
  - For the sake of simplicity, the TestStand sequence handles pin map and session registration and
    unregistration in the `Setup` and `Cleanup` sections of the main sequence. For **Test UUTs** and
    batch process model use cases, these steps should be moved to the `ProcessSetup` and
    `ProcessCleanup` callbacks.
- Uses the NI gRPC Device Server to allow sharing instrument sessions with other measurement
  services when running measurements from TestStand

## Hardware Requirements

- This example requires an NI SMU that is supported by NI-DCPower (e.g. PXIe-4141).

## Simulation Setup

To simulate an NI SMU:

1. Open NI MAX
2. Right-click "Devices and Interfaces"
3. Select "Create New..."
4. Choose "Simulated NI-DAQmx Device or Modular Instrument"
5. Select from "Power Supplies" category
