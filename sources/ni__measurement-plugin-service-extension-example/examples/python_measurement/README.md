# NI-DCPower Source DC Voltage

This is a measurement plug-in example that sources and measures a DC voltage with an NI SMU and
showcases logging measurement data to a custom logging service.

## Features

- Showcases the usage of a user-defined logger service that logs the measurement data.
- Uses the `nidcpower` package to access NI-DCPower from Python
- Demonstrates how to cancel a running measurement by breaking a long wait into multiple short waits
- Includes InstrumentStudio and Measurement Plug-In UI Editor project files
- Includes a TestStand sequence showing how to configure the pin map, register instrument sessions
  with the session management service, and run a measurement
  - The TestStand sequence handles pin map and session registration and unregistration in the
    `Setup` and `Cleanup` sections of the main sequence. For **Test UUTs** and batch process model
    use cases, these steps should be moved to the `ProcessSetup` and `ProcessCleanup` callbacks.
- Uses the NI gRPC Device Server to allow sharing instrument sessions with other measurement
  services when running measurements from TestStand.

## Software Requirements

- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) or later
- [InstrumentStudio 2024
  Q4](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.instrumentstudio.html#549673)
  or later
- [NI-DCPower 2023
  Q1](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-dcpower.html#477835) or later
- [TestStand 2021
  SP1](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.teststand.html#445937) or
  later (recommended)
- [Measurement Plug-In SDK Service
  2.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/ni_measurement_plugin_sdk_service/) or later

## Hardware Requirements

- This example requires an NI SMU that is supported by NI-DCPower (e.g.PXIe-4141).

## Simulation Setup

To enable driver simulation:

1. Create a `.env` file in the measurement service's directory or parent directory or one of its
   parent directories (such as the root of your Git repository or `C:\ProgramData\National
   Instruments\Plug-Ins\Measurements` for statically registered measurement services).
2. Add the following configuration:

```env
MEASUREMENT_PLUGIN_NIDCPOWER_SIMULATE=1
MEASUREMENT_PLUGIN_NIDCPOWER_BOARD_TYPE=PXIe
MEASUREMENT_PLUGIN_NIDCPOWER_MODEL=4141
```
